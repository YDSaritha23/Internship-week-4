# Internship-week-4
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect phishing URLs. By analyzing features derived from URLs and other related data, the model aims to accurately classify websites as legitimate or phishing.
Dataset Description
The dataset consists of URLs and other associated features that can indicate whether a website is phishing or legitimate. Key attributes include:

URL strings: The actual web addresses, which are converted into numeric features for analysis.

Categorical features: Indicators such as domain type or hosting information.

Target variable: Labels indicating whether the URL is phishing (1) or legitimate (0).

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Strings (URLs) were transformed into meaningful numerical features, such as URL length, the number of special characters, and the number of subdomains.

Non-numeric categorical features were encoded using label encoding.

Irrelevant or redundant features were removed to improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Correlation analysis was performed to identify relationships between features and the target variable.

A heatmap highlighted any multicollinearity or redundancy among features.

Feature Selection and Engineering:

Feature importance was evaluated using a Random Forest model.

New features were engineered from URLs to capture patterns indicative of phishing.

Model Building:

A Random Forest Classifier was trained to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate.

The dataset was split into training and testing sets to validate the model.

Model Evaluation:

Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to assess the model's performance.

Key Features Used
URL Length: Longer URLs often indicate phishing attempts.

Number of Special Characters: Phishing URLs frequently use special characters to obfuscate their true nature.

Number of Subdomains: Excessive subdomains can suggest malicious intent.

Additional categorical and numerical features derived from the dataset.

Outcomes
The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy and reliability in detecting phishing URLs.

Feature importance analysis revealed that URL-based features significantly contribute to the detection process.

The engineered features demonstrated strong predictive power, enhancing the model's ability to classify phishing attempts.

Conclusion
This project successfully developed a robust phishing detection model using machine learning. By leveraging URL-based features and feature engineering techniques, the model provides an effective solution for identifying phishing threats, which can be integrated into cybersecurity systems for real-time URL screening.
